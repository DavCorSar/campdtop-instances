# TOP Instances – Train/Test Split

This repository contains the original Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) benchmark instances from Chao et al., which serve as the starting point of our article:

A Learnheuristic Algorithm for Solving the Context-Aware, Multi-Period Dynamic Team Orienteering Problem

The instances are divided into two disjoint subsets:

- train/ → Instances used to train our reward prediction models.
- test/ → Instances used to validate model performance and obtain the computational results with the different optimization approaches.

These are the original benchmark instances introduced by Chao et al. and commonly used in the TOP literature.
